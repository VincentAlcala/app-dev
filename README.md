## 1001 Nights
#### My favorite series is called 1001 Nights. Even though it is a show for kids, I enjoyed it a lot. It is like a story book. Every episodes have different stories that also shows and teaches moral lessons. One of my favorite episode is *"Alin and daan paitaas."* This episode is a story of 2 siblings who always argue with each other. They always have different opinions, but one day they have to choose tough decision as they need to leave their hometown to look for food.
#### They decided to go to mountains but there are two ways to go up. Left and right side. They decided to go on separate directions. In the end they have reach same location. They realized that there's no need to fight with each other and always respect each other's decision.
#### This is a very interesting show that everyone must watch! :joy:
#### I know it not a kind of a show that an adult like me will watch, but we have different interests just like the story from 1001 nights :joy:
